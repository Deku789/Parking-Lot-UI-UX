The structure of the website is as follows:
1) Index.html - This is the main page of the website that shows a representation of the parking lot. The green tiles show the
available spots on the parking lot while the red tiles show spots that have been taken or are reserved for the use of faculty or
persons with disability. There are seperate tabs for 2-wheeler and 4-wheeler vehicles. People can reserve parking spots in advance
and release those parking spots when they are done with the help of the button. There is a status panel which shows information
like the number of parking spots available and which parking spot has been selected by the user if any.

2) Login.html - The student can login through this page. Logging in is necessary to use the service. Once Logged in, the upper
pane with the link shows a welcome message as well as the option to sign out.

3) Instructions.html - This is a static page showing how to use the website as well as the rules and guidelines to be followed by
the user of the website.

The wireframe diagram was created in draw.io and the image file as well the xml file is stored in this repository
